        If you are reporting a new issue, make sure that we do not have any duplicates
        already open. You can ensure this by searching the issue list for this
        repository. If there is a duplicate, please close your issue and add a comment
        to the existing issue instead.

        Please have a look on the following tips before opening the issue:

        <details>
        * If containerd gets stuck on something and enables debug socket, `ctr pprof goroutines`
          dumps the golang stack of containerd, which is helpful! If containerd runs
          without debug socket, `kill -SIGUSR1 $(pidof containerd)` also dumps the stack
          as well.

        * If there is something about running containerd, like consuming more CPU resources,
          `ctr pprof` subcommands will help you to get some useful profiles. Enable debug
          socket makes life easier.

        * `ctr` can't be used for testing CRI configs, as it does not use CRI API.
