# Grafana password bruteforcer
 - This is a script i wrote for a penetration testing activity i was doing and i happened to come across encrypted grafana passwords.
 - So i went ahead to the grafana framework repository to try and understand how the password hashes were being produced
 - Here's the script that got me one of the user's password    

#### Disclaimer
 - This is not a cracking tool , its just a tool that hashes the password using the given salt and compares it to the hash provided, if comparison evaluates to true then kudos! we have a password

* [x] Enjoy :) 

* [x] Give me stars :)
